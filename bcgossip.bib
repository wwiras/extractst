abstract = {Vital societal and industrial autonomous components are increasingly interconnected through communication networks to complete critical tasks cooperatively. However, as the reliability and trust requirements for connected autonomous systems continue to grow, the centralized communication and decision approaches that are in use today are reaching their limits. Focusing on autonomous driving applications, this paper proposes a resilient and trustworthy framework on wireless distributed consensus networks, where the communication links are less reliable or are even in the presence of incorrect local sensor readings/decisions. To accomplish that, a novel three stages consensus mechanism is proposed based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), where the veto collection and gossip stages are designed to meet the stringent and complex requirements for a vehicle's maneuvers. A plan tree synthesis is also proposed to make consensus on a series of decisions while adopting network members' decision preferences. A detailed protocol including the distributed consensus, plan tree synthesis, dynamic grouping, etc. is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed consensus mechanism is able to be reached and propagated through the network under poor wireless communication conditions and the presence of faulty vehicles with incorrect sensor readings. The result can be extended to other autonomous systems to significantly enhance safety in critical industrial applications.},

abstract = {Fault tolerance is one ofthe key characteristics ofdistributed
systems. Efficient failure detection reduces the recovery time
and helps to quickly achieve consensus among the fault-free
systems. Gossip protocol is a widely used framework for fault
detection services in large-scale cloud systems. Basic imple-
mentation lacks in achieving a consistent system state due
to random patterns of Gossip messages that result in false
failure detection. As well as there is no upper bound on con-
sensus time in random way of gossiping. In this project, we
propose to implement the three gossip protocols approach:
Round Robin, Binary Round Robin, and Round Robin with
Sequence Check[1]. We will also implement Distributed Con-
sensus algorithm to maintain the performance and integrity
of the distributed system. We aim to implement and analyze
the claims that Gossip provides under different workload
systems and cases of failure - single, simultaneous and node
rejoining the cluster. These experiments were performed
with specific values of configuration parameters as observed in [3].},

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger consisting of sequence of blocks. These blocks are groups of transactions that make up a sequence where each block contains the cryptographic hash of its prior block. To maintain huge networks, data integrity, and consistency some blockchain deployments uses a distributed communication method known as gossip protocol. In gossip protocol, every node/system relays any recent data to all its neighbors in an atomic fashion where each neighbor imitates the process until the whole system is synchronized. The number of iterations required to synchronize N hosts is O (log N) despite the failing nodes and data losses in transmission. However, the protocol is not cost effective when it comes to number of state exchanges and the transmission delay due to the redundant state information exchanges. To make gossip protocol more efficient; first, we propose a fail-proof algorithm that can be used under zero node failure scenarios; secondly, an opportunistic algorithm giving a rational, stable, and predictable correction phase and lastly a checking algorithm that obtains an iterative correction until a convergence or a synchronization across all the nodes in the system are reached. We implement these improvements and carefully analyze and demonstrate our findings.},
